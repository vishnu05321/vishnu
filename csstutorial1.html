    <h2 id="introduction">What is CSS</h2>
<ul>
    <p><li>
        
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
    </li>  </p>

    <p><li>
        CSS is used to style the appearance of web pages, including the design, layout, and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. 
    </li>  </p>
    
    <p><li>
        CSS allows you to control the appearance of your web page, including the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, the layout of your page, and the background images and colors used. CSS can also be used to add animations and other decorative features to your web pages.
    </li>  </p>

    <p><li>
        
CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994.
</li></p>

    <p><li>
        At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. CSS was developed in response to the need for a way to style web pages without having to embed styling information in the HTML code.
    </li> </p>

    <p><li>
        The first version of CSS was released in 1996. CSS has since been updated and expanded several times, and the latest version, CSS3, is still under development.
    </li>  </p>
    <p><li>
        CSS is now one of the most important web development languages, and it is used to style virtually all web pages. CSS is a powerful and flexible language, and it can be used to create a wide range of different web page designs.
    </li> </p></ul>

    <h2 id="features">Features of CSS</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><p>
            <b>Selectivity: </b> CSS allows you to select specific elements on a web page and apply styles to them. This can be done using a variety of selectors, such as class, ID, and element type.
        </li>
        <li><p>
           <b> Cascade:</b>CSS styles are cascaded, meaning that the most specific style will be applied to an element. This allows you to define global styles for your web page, and then override those styles for specific elements.
        </p> </li>
        <li><p>
            <b>Inheritance:</b>CSS styles are inherited by child elements from their parent elements. This allows you to define a common style for a group of elements, and then override those styles for individual elements.
        </p>  </li>
        <li><p>
            <b>Shorthand properties:</b>CSS provides a number of shorthand properties that allow you to set multiple properties with a single declaration. This can make your CSS code more concise and easier to read.
        </p>  </li>
        <li><p>
            <b>Media queries:</b>CSS media queries allow you to define different styles for different devices and screen sizes. This ensures that your web page looks good on all devices, from desktop computers to smartphones.
        </p>    </li>
       
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Importance">Importance of CSS</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <p><li>
            <b>Improves the appearance of web pages: </b>CSS allows web developers to control the look and feel of their web pages, including the layout, fonts, colors, and other visual elements. This can make web pages more visually appealing and user-friendly.
        </li></p>
        <p><li>
            <b>Separates content from presentation:</b>CSS separates the content of a web page from its presentation. This makes it easier for developers to maintain and update their web pages, as they can make changes to the presentation without affecting the content.
        </li></p>
        <p><li>
            <b>Improves accessibility:</b>CSS can be used to improve the accessibility of web pages for people with disabilities. For example, CSS can be used to increase the font size, change the font color, and add alt text to images.
        </li></p>
      
        <p><li>
            <b>Reduces bandwidth usage:</b>CSS can be used to reduce the bandwidth usage of web pages. This is because CSS styles can be cached by the browser, so they do not need to be downloaded from the server each time the page is loaded.
        </li></p>
        <p><li>
            <b>Improves performance:</b>CSS can improve the performance of web pages by reducing the amount of code that needs to be executed. This is because CSS styles can be applied to multiple elements on a web page with a single declaration.
