    <h2 id="introduction">What is Java</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>

      
            Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a compiled language, meaning that Java code is converted into bytecode, which can then be executed on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
        </p>    </li>

        <li>

Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and it is used by millions of developers to build a wide variety of applications. 
</p>  </li>
        <li><p>
            Java is a class-based language, which means that programs are written using classes and objects. Classes are used to define the blueprint for objects, and objects are used to represent real-world entities, such as users, products, and orders.
        </p>  </li>
        <li><p>
            Java is also a platform-independent language, which means that Java programs can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM is a software program that interprets Java bytecode and translates it into machine code that can be executed by the underlying hardware.


        </li>
        <li><p>
            Java is a popular choice for developing web applications because it is fast, secure, and reliable. Java is also a good choice for developing mobile applications because it is platform-independent and has a large library of pre-written code.

        </p>
