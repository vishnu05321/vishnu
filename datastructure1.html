    <ul>
        <li>
            A data structure is a way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Data structures are used in almost all software programs, and they are essential for many common tasks, such as searching, sorting, and storing data.

            A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used efficiently. It is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. Data structures are used in computer science to store and organize data in a way that makes it easy to access and manipulate.</li>
        </ul>
            <h4>
                Common Data Structure Include :

            <ul>
                <li><p>
                    <b>Arrays : </b>A collection of data items stored in a contiguous block of memory. Arrays are efficient for accessing data sequentially, but can be inefficient for inserting or deleting data.

                <li><p>
                 <b>Linked listsv : </b> A collection of data items stored in nodes that are linked together. Linked lists are efficient for inserting and deleting data, but can be inefficient for accessing data sequentially.

                Features of Data Structure
            </h2>

            <p> <b>Some Key Features of Data Structure are : </b></p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
        <b>Abstraction :</b>A data structure abstracts away the underlying implementation details, allowing programmers to focus on the high-level properties of the data structure.
    </p>  </li>

    <li><p>
        <b>Efficiency :</b>Data structures are designed to be efficient in terms of time and space complexity. This means that they can perform operations on data quickly and while using as little memory as possible.
    </p>   </li>
    <li><p>
        <b>Modularity :</b>Data structures can be combined and reused to create new and more complex data structures. This makes it easier to write and maintain complex code.
    </p>   </li>
    <li><p>
        <b>
            Generality :
        </b>Many data structures are general-purpose, meaning that they can be used to store and manipulate a wide variety of data types. This makes them flexible and reusable.
    </p>  </li>
    
    <p><b>Data structures are a fundamental part of computer science and are used in a wide variety of applications. By understanding the features of data structures, programmers can write more efficient, modular, and reusable code.

</ul>

<h2 id="Importance">Why Data Structure is Important ?</h2>

<p>Data structures are important because they allow programmers to organize and store data in a way that is efficient, scalable, and flexible. Data structures can also help to improve the performance and reliability of software.</p>

<p><b><ul><li>Data Structure is Important for number of reasons :</li></ul></b></p>

<ol>
    <li><p>
        <b>Efficiency  :</b>Data structures can help to improve the efficiency of software by reducing the time and space complexity of common operations such as searching, sorting, and insertion. For example, a binary search tree can be used to search for an item in a sorted list much more efficiently than a linear search.
    </p>   </li>
    <li><p></p>
        <b>Scalability :</b>Data structures can help to improve the scalability of software by making it easier to handle large amounts of data. For example, a graph data structure can be used to represent a large network of computers or social media users.
    </p>  </li>
   <li><p>
        <b>Flexibility :</b> Data structures can help to improve the flexibility of software by making it easier to add new features and functionality. For example, a linked list can be used to implement a queue or a stack.
    </p>   </li>
 <li><p>
        <b>Performance :</b>Data structures can help to improve the performance of software by reducing the amount of memory and CPU usage required to execute certain tasks. For example, a hash table can be used to store key-value pairs in a way that is much more efficient than an unsorted list.
    </p>   </li>
    <li><p>
        <b>
            Reliability :
        </b>Data structures can help to improve the reliability of software by preventing errors such as out-of-bounds memory accesses and infinite loops. For example, a stack can be used to implement function calls in a safe and reliable way.
