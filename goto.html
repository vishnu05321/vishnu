    <h1><center>GoTo Statement</center></h1>
    <p><b>The goto statement in C is a jump statement that allows you to transfer control of the program to a specific label. The syntax of the goto statement is as follows:</b></p>

    
    <pre _ngcontent-ng-c4134454218=""><code _ngcontent-ng-c4134454218="" role="text" class="code-container no-decoration-radius">goto label;
    </code></pre>
 <ul> 
  <li> <p> <b>where label is a valid identifier. When the goto statement is encountered, the program control jumps to the statement labeled with label.</b></p></li>

<p><b>The goto statement can be used to implement a variety of control flow patterns, such as loops, switches, and error handling. However, it is generally considered to be a bad programming practice because it can make code difficult to read and maintain.</b></p>
