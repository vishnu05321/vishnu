    <h2 id="what">What is C++ ?</h2>

    <ul>
  
        <p>
        <li>
            C++ was developed by <b> Bjarne Stroustrup </b>, as an extension to the C language.
        </li>
        </p>
   
        <p>
        <li>
            Despite being an 80s creation, C++ has been a popular programming language throughout these years.
        </li>
        </p>
        <li>
            C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications and software systems.
        </li>
        <p>
        <li>
            C++ is very close to the hardware making it comparatively easy for programmers to give the instructions directly to the system without any intermediary giving programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
        </li>
        </p>

      </ul>
    
       <h2 id="features">Why should we learn C++/ Features of C++?</h2>

       <ul>
       
      <p>
        <li>
        C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>
        In today's operating systems, GUIs, and embedded systems, C++ is widely used.
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>
        It is one of the most popular programming languages for its object-orientedness. C++ is an object-oriented programming language that gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>
        With C++, you can develop applications or heavy games that can run on different platforms.
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>
        As C++ is close to other programming languages such as C# and Java, which makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa while it is actually very easy to learn.
        </li>
      </p>

       </ul>
      
      <h2 id="difference"> How is it different from C?</h2>

      <ul>

      <p>
        <li>
        The syntax of C++ is almost identical to that of C, as C++ was developed as an extension of C.
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>
        In contrast to C, C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not.
        </li>
      </p>

        <b>
            Speed and performance:
        </b>
        C++ is a compiled language that is very close to the hardware, which makes it extremely fast and efficient. This makes it ideal for applications where performance is critical, such as high-performance computing, game development, and embedded systems.
      </p>
        </li>

        <li data-sourcepos="4:1-4:100">

      <p>
        <b>Versatility:</b> C++ is a general-purpose language that can be used to develop a wide range of applications, from operating systems and database servers to web browsers and video games. It is also well-suited for developing low-level system software and high-level algorithms.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li data-sourcepos="4:1-4:100">
      <p>

        <b>Object-oriented programming:</b>C++ is a fully object-oriented language, which means that it supports concepts such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. This makes it possible to write reusable and maintainable code.
      </p>

      </li>

      <li data-sourcepos="4:1-4:100">
      <p>
        <b>Generic programming:</b> C++ supports generic programming, which allows programmers to write code that works with different data types without having to rewrite the code. This makes C++ code more efficient and flexible.
      </p>

      </li>

      <li data-sourcepos="4:1-4:100">
      <p>
        <b>Large community and ecosystem:</b> C++ has a large and active community of developers and users. This means that there is a wealth of resources available to C++ programmers, including libraries, tutorials, and support forums.
