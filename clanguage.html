    <ul>
        <li>
        C language is a general-purpose, procedure oriented programming language, developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at AT & T’S Bell Telephone Laboratories, US. Dennis Ritchie created it to developed Unix Operating System.

    </li>  </p>
    <p> <li>
       If you want to become a Software Engineer, then it very important to have knowledge of some Programming Languages, ​​because you cannot become a software engineer without learning any programming language.
    </li>  </p>
    <p> <li>
        You can start your programming journey with C Language. because C Language is said to be the mother of all other programming languages. When you learn the C programming language very well, then you will be able to learn all other programming languages easily.
    </li>   </p>
    <p> <li>
        In Today’s article, we will learn what is C language?, what is the history of C language, what are the features of C Language, and why C is so important?
    </li>  </p>
    <p>
     <li>   Today I will also tell you how you can learn the C language in a very easy way.
    </li> </p>
    <p>
        <b>
        So let’s know.
    </b>
    </p>
</ul>
    <h2 id="What">Introduction :</h2>
    <ul>
    <p> <li>
        C Language is a general-purpose, programming language. Which was created by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at AT & T’S Bell Telephone Laboratories. Dennis Ritchie wanted to create an operating system named Unix Operating System. to develop it, the C language was developed.
    </li>  </p>
    <p><li>
        The special thing is that we can do low-level programming with the help of C language, due to this feature, C programming language is used to make system software such as Operating system, Device Driver, Compiler, etc.
    </li>  </p>
    <p><li>
        C Language covered the Basic features ( Variable, Data Types, Array, String, Function, Structure, Pointer, Loop, etc.) of all other programming languages, due to which C language is called Mother Language of all other programming languages.
    </li>  </p>
    <p><li>
        Once you learn C language, you can easily learn all other Programming Languages.
    </li>  </p>
    <p><li>
        But do you know what is the history of C language? so let’s know about the history of C language  
    </li>  </p>
</ul>

    <h2 id="History">History of C language :-</h2>
    <ul>
    <p><li>
        Before becoming of C Language, in 1966, a person named Martin Richard created a Programming Language named BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language). It was created at AT & T’S Bell Telephone Laboratories, US, by the combining of basic features of all programming languages.
    </li>
</p>
    <p><li>
        BCPL was not suitable for making large software, as well as coding in low-level style.
    </li>
</p>
    <p><li>
        Ben Thompson, who worked at AT & T’S Bell Telephone Laboratories along with Martin Richard, created the B language in 1969 by improving BCPL.
    </p>
    <p><li>
        Actually, Ken Thompson wanted to create an operating system that needed a good programming language to build and that language was B Language. After creating B language, he created Unix Operating System.
    </li>
</p>
    <p><li>        Dennis Ritchie also worked at AT & T’S Bell Telephone Laboratories, which created C Language in 1972, and told Ken Thompson, if we build the Unix Operating System with the help of C Language, then we can add more features to it. The biggest feature was the operating system being portable.
    </li>
</p>

</ul>
    <h2>Features of C Language</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
        
            <p><li>C is a simple and easy programming language.</li></p>

                <p><li>There are commands/instructions like English in C language which are very easy for a programmer to read, understand, and code.</li></p>

                        <p><li>C is a very powerful and case sensitive <p>  <li>C Language is a Compiler based dynamic programming language.</li></p>

                            <p><li>C language is a middle level language due to which both low level and high level programming can be done.</li></p>

          <p><li>The C language is the most commonly used programming language in developing operating systems and embedded systems.</li></p>

            <p><li>C language is a very portable and powerful programming language.</li></p>

                <p><li>C language is a Syntax Based Language.</li></p>
                    <p><li>C is a general purpose programming language that covers basic features of all other languages.
            </li></p>

    <h2 id="Learn">How to Learn C Language</h2>
    <p>
        <li>
        C language is also like a natural language. Natural language – like Hindi, English is the medium of communication between two human beings similarly, C language is also a means of communication between humans and computers.
        </li>
    </p>

    <p>
        <li>
        Just like we learn Hindi or English, we have to learn the same language.
        </li>
    </p>

    <p>
        <li>
        Remember when you have learned English, first you have learned its basics like – Alphabets, Characters, Special Symbols, then you must have learned to create Word using it, then Sentence from Word and Paragraph from Sentence.
        </li>
    </p>
    <p>
        <li>
        Similarly, in C language, we will learn some basics like – Tokens, Identifiers, Keyword, Instructions, and when we learn how to make Instructions, then we will start making programs and then software.
