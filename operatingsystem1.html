            An operating system (OS) is software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is an essential component of the system software in a computer system. Application programs usually require an operating system to function.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            
The operating system performs basic tasks, such as controlling and monitoring the use of the central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage devices; and providing common services, such as input and output (I/O) services, a file system, and a network interface. It also provides an interface between the application programs and the computer hardware.
        </p>
    </li>

    <p><b>The operating system is responsible for a wide range of tasks, including:
    </b>
    </p>
    <li><p>
        Booting the computer and loading the operating system and other necessary programs into memory.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        Providing security features to protect the computer from viruses and other malware
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        Managing the computer's memory and processor resources.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        Providing a user interface for interacting with the computer.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        Managing the computer's files and storage devices.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        Providing support for networking and other communication devices.
    </p></li>
    </ul>

     <h2 id="Importance">Importance of Operating System :</h2>

     
      <ul> 
        <li><p>The operating system (OS) is the most important software that runs on a computer. It is responsible for managing all of the computer's resources, including the CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices. Without an operating system, a computer would be useless.</p>
    </li>  

    <p>
        <b>The following reasons why Operating System is important :-</b>
    </p>
    <li><p><b>
        It provides a layer of abstraction between the hardware and the software : 
    </b>This means that software developers can write programs without having to know the specific details of the underlying hardware. This makes it easier to write programs and to port them to different types of computers.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>
        It manages the computer's resources efficiently :
    </b>The operating system decides which programs get to use the CPU, memory, and other resources at any given time. This ensures that all of the programs running on the computer have the resources they need to operate.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>
        It provides a user interface :
    </b>The operating system provides a way for users to interact with the computer. This includes things like the graphical user interface (GUI), the command-line interface (CLI), and the various system tools and utilities.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>
        It provides security features :
    </b>The operating system helps to protect the computer from viruses, malware, and other security threats. This includes things like firewalls, antivirus software, and access control lists.</p></li>
    
</ul>

<h2 id="Features">Features of it :</h2>

<ul>
    <li><p><b>
        Booting :
    </b>The operating system boots the computer and loads the necessary programs into memory.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>
        Process management :
    </b>The operating system manages the execution of programs, including allocating resources, scheduling them for execution, and terminating them when they are finished.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>
        Memory management :
    </b>The operating system manages the computer's memory resources, including allocating memory to programs, swapping memory to disk, and providing virtual memory.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>
        File management :
    </b>The operating system provides a file system for storing and organizing files.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>
        Device management :
    </b>The operating system manages the computer's hardware devices, including loading device drivers and providing access to the devices.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>
        Networking :
    </b>The operating provides support for networking, including connecting to networks, sending and receiving data, and sharing resources.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>
        Security  
    </b>The operating system provides security features to protect the computer from viruses, malware, and other threats.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>
        User interface :
    
</b>The operating system provides a user interface for interacting with the computer. This includes things like the graphical user interface (GUI), the command-line interface (CLI), and the various system tools and utilities.
In addition to these general features, operating systems also </p></li>
